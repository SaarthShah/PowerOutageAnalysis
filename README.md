## Introduction

In this study we will be exploring the [Power Outage Dataset](https://dsc80.com/project3/power-outages). This dataset contains datapoints for the major power outage data in the continental U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016. Overall this dataset contains 1534 power outage events that happened in the United States.

Some of the relevant columns that the dataset entails contains information about where and when outages happened, how many people were affected, the population breakdown of where this event happened, cause of the power outage, price of electricity, etc. 

> YEAR: Contains the year when this event happened <br>
> U.S._STATE: Name of the US State where the Outage Happened <br>
> OUTAGE.DURATION: How long did each duration last <br>
> CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED: How many people got affected <br>
> CAUSE.CATEGORY: The reported reason for the Outage <br>
> CLIMATE.CATEGORY: Current climate where the outage was reported <br>
> OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE: Date when the outage was resolved <br>
> OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME: Time when the outage was resolved <br>
> OUTAGE.START.DATE: Date when the outage was reported <br>
> OUTAGE.START.TIME: Time when the outage was reported <br>

Our goal while exploring this dataset is to better understand the factors that may be affecting how long these power outages last.
